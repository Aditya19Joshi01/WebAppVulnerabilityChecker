# **Web Application Vulnerability Scanner**

## **Overview**

The Web Application Vulnerability Scanner is a Python-based tool designed to help identify common vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It crawls a target web application, identifies input fields, and tests these fields with various payloads to detect potential security flaws.

## **Features**

- **Crawling**: Scans the target URL to find all accessible links within the domain.
- **Form Detection**: Identifies forms and input fields on each crawled page.
- **Vulnerability Testing**:
  - **SQL Injection**: Tests input fields for SQL Injection vulnerabilities by submitting specially crafted payloads.
  - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Tests input fields for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting JavaScript payloads.

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `BeautifulSoup4`

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## **Usage**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aditya19Joshi01/WebAppVulnerabilityChecker.git
   ```

2. **Run the Scanner**:
   ```bash
   python VulnerablityChecker.py
   ```

3. **Input the Target URL**: When prompted, enter the URL of the web application you want to scan.

## **Project Structure**

- `VulnerabilityChecker.py`: Main script that includes crawling, form detection, and vulnerability testing.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## **How It Works**

1. **Crawling**:
   - The scanner begins by crawling the provided target URL, identifying all links within the web applicationâ€™s domain.
   
2. **Form Detection**:
   - For each page, the scanner uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and locate forms. It extracts relevant data, including form actions, methods (GET or POST), and input fields.

3. **Vulnerability Testing**:
   - **SQL Injection**: The scanner tests input fields by submitting common SQL Injection payloads and analyzing responses for typical SQL error messages.
   - **XSS**: The scanner tests input fields by injecting common XSS payloads and checking if the payloads are reflected in the response.

## **Example Output**

```
Found 10 links on http://example.com:
http://example.com/page1
http://example.com/page2
...

Scanning http://example.com/page1 for input fields...
Found 2 forms on http://example.com/page1:
  Form action: /submit | Method: post
    Input name: username | Type: text
    Input name: password | Type: password

[SQL Injection] Potential vulnerability detected at /submit with payload: ' OR '1'='1

Scanning http://example.com/page2 for input fields...
No vulnerabilities found for this form.
